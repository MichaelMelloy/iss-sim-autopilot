# iss-sim-autopilot
SpaceX ISS-Simulator Autopilot written in Python using Selenium Webdriver


Dependencies:

	Mozilla Firefox

	Geckodriver (Place in Python Path)

	Python


This simple autopilot will automatically dock the Dragon capsule to the ISS in SpaceX's online Space Sim.
This does not work well on slower machines due to slow reaction times when updating values using Selenium.
A slower version for weaker machines will be added aswell.
